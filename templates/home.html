        <p id="paragraph">As our environment changes, so do our relationships to each other and to the land. In the face of climate
change we wanted to understand better what is happening around our state to address the effects of
these changes and create solutions to adapt and mitigate. This database takes the first step in
understanding how the puzzle pieces fit together, and is intended to provide a platform for Alaskan
citizens, communities, and organizations to see what efforts have taken place and are currently ongoing.
By clicking through this website you can explore all the entities that have their toe in the Alaskan
sandbox, and what types of endeavors they have undertaken.</p>

<div id="mainHeader">
  <h4 align="center"><u>Our Project</u></h4>
</div>

<p id="paragraph">This initial database was built from from the personal knowledge and web-based
  searched of UAS Professor Jim Powell, UAA Professor Martin Cenek, and First Alakans Institute
  Fellow Sigvanna Topkok early on in 2017 for the Lt. Governor's Office of Alaska. It has since
  been expanded to be available to the public with the help of UAA students Eugene Han and Thomas Marquez.
</p>
<p id="paragraph"> Each entity listed in this database is coded in several ways: first by what type of organization they are
(NGO; state or federal; for profit; etc.) as well as by their geographical reach (local; state-wide;
international; web-based). Here you can see what organizations around the world are working on in
relation to our state and where they are doing some of their work. We developed this tool so we could
better understand these existing critical partnerships and to encourage new relationships, as well. Our
hope is that our state citizens can also access this database to learn what is happening in their
community and how they can be involved.

<p id="paragraph">We did our best to verify the accuracy of the information presented. If you are interested,
  there is also the ability to submit (or modify) your organization's information under the "Add Organization"
  tab, so we can keep our database up to date and accurate as possible. Most importantly, this is meant to be
  a living database that grows and changes as new players come on the scene and new partnerships are formed.
  We hope you find it useful!
